Work done from Razbury Game Internship

The files in this project are part of the work I did during my Game Design Internship at Razbury Games. The projects goal
was to create a glossary system where players can easily look up descriptions of each icon in the game. I started from scratch
and worked on everything from initial design, code design, programming, UI, and QA. The biggest design conponents for this
project was ease of use for the player and reusability for future designers to easily add more icons as the game grows in size.
